# Patches

## pyconfig-3.X.Y.h

Not a patch, a file copied from the 3.X.Y Windows distribution, to simplify
the build, since the embedded archive does not include it.

To get it

- on a Windows machine
- go to <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/>
- enter the 3.X.Y folder
- get the `python-3.X.Y-amd64.exe`
- install it
- go to `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3X\include`
- copy `pyconfig.h`
